# Spam Classifier using Machine Learning

![Spam Classifier](https://your-image-url.com)

## Overview

This project implements a spam classifier using machine learning. The goal is to classify emails or messages as either spam or not spam (ham) based on their content. The classifier is trained on a labeled dataset containing examples of both spam and ham messages.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/spam-classifier.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Download the pre-trained model (if available) or train your own using the instructions in [Model Training](#model-training).

2. Run the classifier on new data:

   ```bash
   python predict.py --input_text "Your message here"
   ```

## Dataset

Describe the dataset you used for training and testing the spam classifier. Include details such as the source, size, and format of the data.

## Preprocessing

Explain the steps taken to preprocess the data before training the model. This may include tasks like cleaning, tokenization, and handling missing values.

## Feature Extraction

Describe the features used for training the machine learning model. This could include bag-of-words representation, TF-IDF, word embeddings, etc.

## Model Training

Provide details on how to train the spam classifier model. Include information about the chosen algorithm, hyperparameters, and any additional settings.

```bash
python train.py --data_path /path/to/training_data.csv --model_save_path /path/to/save/model
```

## Evaluation

Explain how the model's performance is evaluated. Include metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

```bash
python evaluate.py --model_path /path/to/saved/model --test_data_path /path/to/test_data.csv
```

## Results

Share the results of the spam classifier, including performance metrics and any visualizations that help illustrate the model's effectiveness.
